# Execute Implementation Plan

## Role

You are the **orchestrator**. You do not implement tasks yourself — each task runs in a subagent with a fresh context, so a late task in a long plan gets the same clean context as the first one. Your own context holds only the overview, the TODO list, and each subagent's short report; you never read task files or source code.

## Before starting

1. **Read the overview file** at `<mise-directory>/implementation_plan/00_overview.md`. This is the ONLY plan file you read — never the task files.

2. **Get `tasks_done`** from the state-engine report that dispatched you (or run `node ../scripts/state.ts report <mise-directory>`) — a task is done exactly when its file sits in `implementation_plan/done/`, and the report reads that directory. Those tasks are complete from a previous session — exclude them. If all tasks are done, go straight to the acceptance pass (below).

3. **Baseline gate** — before the plan's first task only (`done/` is empty): run the project's Format, Check, and Unit-test commands (from `.claude/mise-config.md`). If anything fails, stop and report — the plan must start from a green baseline so that every later failure is unambiguously the work's to fix; pre-existing failures are the user's call, never yours. On a resumed session (tasks already in `done/`), skip the gate: every checkpoint ended green, so anything red now was introduced by this plan's work — the next subagent's verification catches and fixes it, and nothing mid-plan is ever "pre-existing".

4. **Build the TODO list** from the remaining Task Index rows in the overview, in order, one entry per task:

   `Implement <mise-directory>/implementation_plan/<filename>`

## Executing tasks

Work through the TODO list in order. For each entry:

1. Mark it as in_progress.
2. **Dispatch a fresh implementer subagent** (general-purpose Agent, run synchronously; role `implementer` per Model routing) with this prompt, all paths absolute:

   > Read and follow the instructions at `<skill-dir>/stages/implement_task.md`.
   > Subject task file: `<path to this task's file>`
   > Progress log: `<mise-directory>/implementation_plan/_progress.md`
   > Mise config: `<project>/.claude/mise-config.md`

   The subagent implements, verifies, self-reviews, appends to the progress log, commits, and reports back either success (commit hash + summary) or a failure report.

3. **On failure**, route by the report's kind (`implement_task.md` defines both):
   - **`blocked`** (missing dependency or API, design contradiction) → no retry can fix it: stop and relay the report to the user (see Stopping rules).
   - **`stuck`** (out of hypotheses) → dispatch ONE fresh implementer for the same task, same prompt plus one line: `> Previous attempt's failure report: <the report>` — a fresh context often finds the approach a stuck one couldn't, and the report keeps it from repeating what failed. If the retry fails too, either kind, stop and relay both reports.

   Either kind, log friction per `../references/interaction.md` (`task <ID>: <blocked|stuck> — <one-line cause>`). Never fix it yourself, and never dispatch a second retry.

4. **On success, dispatch a fresh reviewer subagent** (fresh context catches what the author's context rationalizes away; role `reviewer` per Model routing). Prompt it to: read the task file, run `git show <commit hash>`, and check the diff for missed requirements from the task spec, non-compliance with the task's Guides entries, bugs, security issues, and leftover debug code — reporting a list of concrete defects, or "none". Include any config Skills & guides entries whose condition targets reviewing this kind of work. Missing test coverage is a defect only if no Test exception cited in the task file excuses it. Ignore cosmetic nits. If it reports real defects, log friction (`task <ID>: review found <defects, one line>`) and dispatch one fix subagent (role `implementer` per Model routing) with the defect list and the same implement_task.md instructions (its task: fix the defects, re-verify, commit). One review/fix round per task — if the fix subagent's commit still looks wrong, stop and report.
5. Record the task by moving its file into `done/` — `mkdir -p <mise-directory>/implementation_plan/done && git mv <mise-directory>/implementation_plan/<task file> <mise-directory>/implementation_plan/done/` — and commit (e.g. `mise: task <task ID> done`). The move is the completion record: it's what lets any checkout of the branch resume without redoing work. Mark the TODO entry completed and move on.

## Acceptance pass, then retrospective, then cleanup, then ship

After the last task (or when dispatched with everything already done), walk the steps below from 1. Dispatched with `close_out` instead — a prior session already recorded and committed the user's confirmation — start at step 4's retrospective, skipping its recording clause (honor `Retrospective: off` as usual); if the retrospective also already ran (its adoption commit exists, or the user says so), start at step 6:

1. **Dispatch a fresh acceptance subagent** (role `acceptance` per Model routing). Prompt it to: read `requirements.md` (`goals.md` on the bugfix route), read the plan overview and `_progress.md`, inspect the feature branch's commits, and verify each requirement is actually addressed — running the relevant e2e tests (via the Skills & guides entry that covers running them, when one is listed — honor its `required` flag) or the Test exceptions' substitute verifications where those apply. It returns a checklist: each requirement/goal with a verdict (verified — with what evidence · not verified — why) plus anything unverifiable.
2. **Present the checklist to the user** and ask whether to close the feature out. This and the goals gate are the pipeline's only human gates.
3. Items the user flags as wrong are blockers: log friction (`acceptance: user flagged <item> — <why>`, per `../references/interaction.md`), dispatch fix subagents (role `implementer` per Model routing) with the specifics, then re-run the acceptance pass.
4. On the user's confirmation, record it — run `node ../scripts/state.ts approve <mise-directory> acceptance` and commit (e.g. `mise: accept`) — so an interrupted close-out resumes here (`close_out`) instead of re-running the pass. Then run the **retrospective** — skip straight to cleanup when the config has `Retrospective: off`. Dispatch a fresh retrospective subagent (general-purpose Agent, run synchronously; role `retrospective` per Model routing; a fresh context judges the run's friction without the attachment of having produced it) with this prompt, all paths absolute:

   > Read and follow the instructions at `<skill-dir>/stages/retrospective.md`.
   > Mise directory: `<mise-directory>`
   > Mise config: `<project>/.claude/mise-config.md`

   It returns numbered improvement proposals, or no proposals — then just say so and go to cleanup. Present the proposals verbatim with the subagent's `Recommend` line and ask which to adopt, by number. Adopting is never required to finish — the work is already accepted, and rejecting everything just means cleanup.

5. **Apply the adopted proposals** exactly as proposed — they touch only project guidance (the config, `CLAUDE.md`, guide docs, a new doc plus its config registration line), never source code or the plugin's files — and commit them as one ordinary (non-`mise:`) commit, e.g. `Adopt retrospective learnings: <summary>`: guidance edits are durable project content, not workflow bookkeeping. Relay plugin-candidate items as information for the user to take upstream; never act on them.
6. **Clean up**: delete the mise directory `<mise-directory>/` entirely and commit the deletion (e.g. `mise: cleanup`) — the artifacts served their purpose; the merged history keeps the code and tests, not the docs. Report the feature finished.
7. **Ship** per the config's `Ship` value: `pr` → push the branch and open a pull request summarizing the finished work; `merge` → merge the work branch into the default branch using the merge style recorded in the value (e.g. `merge (squash)`; no style recorded → ask); `off` → the user ships manually — just report the branch ready. No `Ship` value in the config → ask the user which of the three to do now, and suggest recording the answer via `/mise:next setup`. If shipping fails (auth, conflicts), report the branch name and the chosen action for the user to finish by hand — the work itself is already complete.

## Stopping rules

Stop only on real blockers: the baseline gate failing, a `blocked` failure report, an implementer's `stuck` report that survived its one fresh retry, a fix subagent failing or its commit still looking wrong after review, or a genuine ambiguity unresolvable from the task file/codebase/config. If a subagent reports that a task file authorizes a red intermediate state, treat it as a planning bug — stop and ask the user to regenerate the plan. Otherwise keep going.

## Do not

- Implement tasks or read task files in your own context — only the overview and subagent reports
- Skip the baseline gate before the plan's first task, or let a subagent skip verification
- Ask the user for confirmation between tasks while everything is green — just continue
- Retry a failed task more than once — one fresh implementer for a `stuck` report, none for `blocked`
- Skip the acceptance pass or delete the mise directory before the user confirms the checklist
- Create a PR or merge before the cleanup commit lands — shipping is the close-out's final step, never earlier
- Apply a retrospective proposal the user didn't adopt, or let one touch source code or plugin files
- Ask the user which rule wins when a task note conflicts with a skill default — task notes never win on safety/verification rules
