# mise — Claude Code workflow skills

A Claude Code plugin for building complex features autonomously. You describe the goal up front; requirements, planning, and execution run unattended, with fresh-context critic and reviewer agents checking the work at every stage.

The name comes from _mise en place_ — prep everything before the pan gets hot.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/ericvera/mise-claude-plugin
```

```
/plugin install mise@ericvera
```

Requires Node.js 24+ on your PATH — the workflow's [state engine](docs/state-machine.md) is TypeScript that Node 24+ [runs natively](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively), no build step.

### Update

```
/plugin update mise@ericvera
```

## Usage

The plugin exposes a single command. The first run in a project walks you through configuration; `/mise:next setup` revisits it later. All project-specific details (paths, branch convention, commands, mock conditions, test exceptions, model delegation) live in the generated `.claude/mise-config.md` — the skill itself stays project-agnostic.

| Command                       | What it does                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/mise:next`                  | Run the next stage of the work in flight (or start new work) |
| `/mise:next some description` | Start a new feature or bug fix from that description         |
| `/mise:next ?`                | Describe the next stage without running it                   |
| `/mise:next setup`            | (Re)run project configuration                                |

You can also just describe a bug or ask "what should I work on next?" in plain chat.

## How it works

One piece of work per branch, driven entirely by `/mise:next` — starting new work creates the branch from your configured naming convention (or offers to reuse the branch you're on). You're needed at exactly two points — everything in between runs unattended, for hours if needed.

1. **Goals** _(human gate)_ — a conversation that critiques your goal, asks one batched round of questions, and iterates on an HTML mock when configured. You approve once.
2. **Requirements** — generated from the goals and mock, assumptions recorded explicitly, self-approved by a critic agent.
3. **Plan** — a fine-grained implementation plan with full-context task files, self-approved by a critic agent.
4. **Execute** — each task runs in a fresh-context subagent, is reviewed, committed, and tracked so the run can resume from any checkout. Every dispatched subagent has a named role, and the config's `Models` section can delegate roles to cheaper models — generation work (implementer, explore, retrospective) moves down while the quality gates (reviewer, critic, acceptance) default to your session model.
5. **Acceptance** _(human gate)_ — a requirement-by-requirement checklist; on your confirmation a retrospective mines the run for improvements to your project's guides and config (you adopt or reject each proposal), the working docs are cleaned up, and the branch ships per your configured `Ship` value (open a PR, merge to the default branch, or leave shipping to you). The output is the shipped code and tests — plus whatever guidance you adopted, so runs get better over time.

Bug fixes take a shortened route: a bug-understanding conversation, then a fixed test-driven plan — write the failing regression test, then fix without touching it.

The same workflow by actor — the USER column is active at exactly two stops, the two human gates (the retrospective's adopt/reject rides the second one):

```text
  USER                  |  ORCHESTRATOR                     |  SUBAGENTS
------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------------
  describe the work ----|--> goals conversation (+ mock)    |
  [? approve goals? ] <-|--- present goals (+ mocks)        |
    feedback -----------|--> revise, present again (loop)   |
    explicit yes -------|--> approve goals, commit          |
                        |  - - - unattended from here - - - |
                        |  write requirements --------------|--> critic: severity-tagged defects
                        |  revise on blockers, commit <-----|---- (stall: recurring blockers / round budget)
                        |  write plan ----------------------|--> critic (same loop)
                        |                                   |
                        |  for each task: dispatch ---------|--> implementer, then reviewer
                        |                                   |      (defects --> fix subagent)
                        |  task done, commit (loop)         |
                        |                                   |
                        |  acceptance pass -----------------|--> checker: per-item verdicts
  [? confirmed? ] <-----|--- present the checklist          |
    items wrong --------|--> fix, re-run acceptance (loop)  |
    confirmed ----------|--> retrospective -----------------|--> retro: proposals + evidence
  [? adopt which? ] <---|--- present proposals              |
    picks --------------|--> apply picked, commit           |
                        |  cleanup: delete mise dir         |
                        |  ship: PR / merge / off, done     |
------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------------
```

**Caveat:** the results are exactly as good as your verification. The workflow leans hard on linters, unit tests, and especially end-to-end coverage to keep long autonomous runs grounded.

## Design

mise targets the tier of work beyond what a single prompt or Claude Code's plan mode handles well:

1. **Trivial** — one-shot prompt.
2. **Moderate ambiguity** — plan mode asks clarifying questions and plans before coding.
3. **Complex feature** — needs externally imposed rigor. This is what mise is for.

The design follows three principles:

- **Optimize for autonomous runs.** Much of the machinery exists so the work can run overnight and progress unattended for hours at a time.
- **Force thinking at the correct level.** Left alone, an agent jumps straight into coding. The stages focus it on one layer at a time: goals, requirements, design, implementation.
- **Create artifacts at each step.** Artifacts enable review, avoid over-reliance on context, and provide natural rewind checkpoints. They are scaffolding, not deliverables: committed to the feature branch as work progresses (so a dead machine costs nothing and any checkout resumes the work), then removed in a final cleanup commit. The durable output is the code, its tests, and the git history.

## Development

Load the plugin straight from a checkout:

```
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/workflow-skills
```

When editing or adding skill and instruction files, follow the conventions in the [skill authoring guide](docs/skill-authoring.md). The state engine's specification lives in [state-machine.md](docs/state-machine.md); its tests run with `node --test skills/next/scripts/state.test.ts`.
